Classical simulation codes typically contain a good selection of analytical forms for describing atomic interactions. Sometimes however, you may need to use a  potential that is not directly supported by the code. Luckily, most simulation codes allow you to provide tabulated potentials in which energies and forces, for a range of interatomic separations, are pre-calculated and specified as rows within a text file. The ``atsim.potentials`` package provides python modules to make the specification and tabulation of pair- and many-body potentials straightforward and consistent.

The following codes are supported for pair-potential tabulation:

* `LAMMPS`_ 
* `DL_POLY`_ 

    
Embedded Atom Model (EAM) potential tabulation is supported in the following formats:

* DYNAMO - as used by `LAMMPS`_ and several other codes.
* `DL_POLY`_
