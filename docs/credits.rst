``atsim.potentials`` is developed and maintained by `Michael Rushton`_.  It was intially developed to support the activities of the `Atomistic Simulation Group`_ located in the `Department of Materials`_ at `Imperial College London`_. Thanks go to Prof. Robin Grimes and the rest of the group. Particular thanks must goes to:

	* `Michael Cooper`_ who helped test and debug the Embedded Atom Method tabulation methods whilst we developed our `actinide potential model`_ for the following:

		* M.W.D. Cooper, M.J.D. Rushton and R. W. Grimes, "A many-body potential approach to modelling the thermomechanical properties of actinide oxides", *J. Phys. Condens. Matter*, 2014 **26** 105401. `doi:10.1088/0953-8984/26/10/105401 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-8984/26/10/105401>`_ 
		
	* **Dr. Clare Bishop** for providing an early implementation of the spline interpolation method implemented within :class:`.SplinePotential`.
